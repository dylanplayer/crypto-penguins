# Crypto Penguins App

CryptoPenguins are the newest NFT collection on the market and are sure to be worth millions in no time! There are thousands of CryptoPenguin NFTs, each generated based on genetic rarity of different features, accessories, and settings -- be on the lookout for super rare Mars penguins, seaweed leis, and hypnotizing eyes. :-)

We built each SVG layer in Figma and we generate the complete image by code, overlaying each selected layer onto a single canvas. Our smart contract is connected to the Sepolia Test Network and with our Next Auth crypto wallet login, it's easy to connect your Metamask wallet. Once you see a cryptopenguin you like, you can mint it and make it your own, then see a record of the transaction on Etherscan! We use ERC 721 tokens, the standard for non-fungible tokens, so you can trust that your token is 100% unique and 100% owned by you and only you!
